As agreed by the Inter -agency and Expert Group on SDG Indic ators (IAEG -SDGs), data for the 
education component only  of indicator 1.a.2 are provided by two custodian agencies (co -custodians 
IMF and UNESCO -UIS) to provide maximum country coverage. Therefore, the Global SDG Indicators 
Database includes two distinct d ata series for the education component, supplied by these different 
data providers (the co -custodians). Each provider employs unique data collection and calculation 
methods. Consequently, variations may arise when comparing the datasets: SG_XPD_EDUC (provi ded 
by IMF as part of a set that contains all  components of indicator 1.a.2 and the total) and 
SD_XPD_ESED (provided by UNESCO -UIS for the education component only). To gain insight into the Last updated:  2024-06-28 
methodologies used by each provider, please review the additiona l metadata file associated with 
indicator 1.a.2.
