The indicator reflects the proportion of persons effectively covered by a social protection system, 
including social protection floors. It also reflects the main components of social protection: child and 
maternity benefits, support for persons without a j ob, persons with disabilities, victims of work injuries 
and older persons.  
 
Effective coverage of social protection is measured by the number of people who are either actively 
contributing to a social insurance scheme or receiving benefits (contributory o r non -contributory).  
 
  
Social protection systems include contributory and non -contributory schemes for children, pregnant 
women with newborns, people in active age, older persons, for victims of work injuries and persons with 
disabilities. Social  protection floors provide at least a basic level in all main contingencies along the life 
cycle, as defined in the Social Protection Floors Recommendation 2012 (no. 202) referred to in SDG 1.3.  
 
When assessing coverage and gaps in coverage, distinctions need to be made between coverage by (1) 
contributory social insurance, (2) universal schemes covering all residents (or all residents in a given 
category), and (3) means -tested schemes potentially covering all those who pass the required test of 
income and /or assets.
