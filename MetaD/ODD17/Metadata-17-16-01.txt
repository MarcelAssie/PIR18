The indicator tracks the number of countries reporting progress in multi -stakeholder monitoring 
frameworks that track the implementation of development effectiveness commitments supporting the 
achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs).   
 
  
“Multi -stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks” that track effective development 
cooperation are monitoring frameworks:  
• whose indicators have been agreed on a voluntary basis; whose indicators measure the strength 
of the relationship  between development actors;  
• where data collection and review are led by the countries themselves; and where participation in 
data collection and review involves relevant stakeholder s representing, at minimum, the public 
sector, the private sector and c ivil society organizations.  
 
The indicator takes into account the need to capture the respective roles and responsibilities of all parties 
involved in multi -stakeholder partnerships for development. It does so by looking at development 
effectiveness framew orks that are led by countries but include the participation of all relevant 
development partners.  
 
The Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (Global Partnership) monitoring 
framework is an example of existing development effectiveness monitoring frameworks. There are other 
complementary efforts, such as the United Nations Economic and Social Council ( ECOSOC ) Development 
Cooperation Forum (DCF) mutual accountability survey. Emerging and future monitoring frameworks that 
fit the above def inition, such as recent efforts to track South -South Cooperation by  the Ibero -American 
General Secretariat  (SEGIB ), could also be considered.
