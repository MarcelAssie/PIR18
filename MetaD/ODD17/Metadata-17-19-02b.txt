This information refers only to 17.19. 2b: Proportion of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth 
registration and 80 per cent death registration . 
 
According to the Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System, Revision 3 
(https://un stats.un.org/unsd/demographic/standmeth/principles/M19Rev3en.pdf), a complete civil 
registration is defined as: “The registration in the civil registration system of every vital event that has 
occurred to the members of the population of a particular coun try (or area), within a specified period as a 
result of which every such event has a vital registration record and the system has attained 100 per cent 
coverage.”  
 
In a given  country or area, the level of completeness of birth registration can be different from the level 
of completeness of death registration.  
 
There exist several methods for the evaluation of completeness of birth or death registration systems.  
An elaboratio n of these methods is available at Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics 
System, Revision 3.  The evaluation and monitoring of quality and completeness of birth and death 
registration systems are addressed in Part three, sub -Chapters: (D). Quality assessment methods; (E). 
Direct versus indirect assessment, and (F). Choosing appropriate methods for assessing completeness and 
qualitative accuracy of registration and register -based vital statistics (para 579 to 622).  
 
Indicator 17.19. 2b has two parts; the first concerning the birth registration and the second concerning 
the death registration of each individual country or area.
