Tariffs: Tariffs are customs duties on merchandise imports, levied either on an ad valorem basis 
(percentage of value) or on a specific basis (e.g. $7 per 100 kg). Tariffs can be used to create a price 
advantage for similar locally -produced goods and for raising government revenues. Trade remedy 
measures and taxes are not considered to be tariffs. Tariff in HS chapters 01 -97 is taken into 
consideration.  
 
Tariff line or National Tariff lines (NTL): National Tariff Line codes refer to the classification codes, applied 
to merchandise goods by individual countries that are longer than the HS six digit level. Countries are free 
to introduce national distinction s for tariffs and many other purposes.  
 
The national tariff line codes are based on the HS system but are longer than six digits. For example, the 
six digit HS code 010120 refers to Asses, mules and hinnies, live, whereas the US National Tariff line code 
010120.10 refers to live purebred breeding asses, 010120.20 refers to live asses other than purebred 
breeding asses and 010120.30 refers to mules and hinnies imported for immediate slaughter.
