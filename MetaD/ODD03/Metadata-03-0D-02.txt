• Presumptive methicillin -resistant  S. aureus  (MRSA)  isolates as defined by oxacillin  minimum 
inhibitory concentration (MIC)  and cefoxitin disc diffusion tests accordin g to current 
internationally recognized clinical breakpoints (e.g.,  EUCAST or CLSI)1  
• E. coli  resistant to third generation cephalosporins:  E. coli  isolates that are resistant as defined by 
current internationally recognized clinical breakpoints for third  generation cephalosporins
