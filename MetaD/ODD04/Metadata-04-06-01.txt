The proportion of youth (aged 15 -24 years) and of adults (aged 15 years and above) who have achieved 
or exceeded a fixed level of proficiency in (a) literacy and (b) numeracy.  
 
  
The fixed level of proficiency  (FLP)  is the benchmark of basic knowledge in a domain (literacy or 
numeracy) measured through learning assessments. Currently, the FLP for global reporting is the 
Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies ( PIAAC ) level 2 descriptor .

The concepts of functional literacy and functional numeracy are based on the UNESCO definitions, which 
cover a continuum of proficiency levels rather than a dichotomy. A person is functionally literate if he/she 
can engage in all those activities in which lite racy is required for the effective functioning of his/her group 
and community and also which enables them to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for 
his/her own and the communityâ€™s development.
