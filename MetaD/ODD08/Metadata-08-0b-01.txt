The proposed methodology draws on:  
a. Global policy instruments, notably:  
o Resolution on The youth employment crisis: A call for action1, adopted at the 101st session of the 
International Labour Conference (ILC) in June 2012. In calling for vigorous, collective action to 
address an aggravated youth employment crisis, this resolution advocates for a multi -pronged 
approach with policy measures that are c ontext -specific and integrated, entailing strategies

which bring together in a coherent manner a variety of instruments to increase the demand, 
enhance the supply and improve matching in youth labour markets.  
o Recovering from the crisis: A Global Jobs Pact2 adopted by the ILC at its June 2009 session. Based 
on the ILO’s Decent Work Agenda, the Global Jobs Pact presents an integrated portfolio of 
policies that puts employment and social protection at the centre of crisis response, recognising 
the critical ro le of participation and social dialogue.    
b. ILO databases:  
o International monitoring of youth employment policies was carried out over the period 2010 -
2012 by the Youth Employment Network (YEN) – a partnership between the ILO, United Nations 
and World Bank – utilising a questionnaire sent to national authorities. T his evolved into 
YouthPOL3, an inventory of youth employment policies and programmes maintained by the ILO 
(65 countries covered to date).  
o The ILO also maintains EmPol , a dataset of broader national employment policies (143 countries 
covered ).
