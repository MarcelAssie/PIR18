Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow accounting (MFA) indicator and 
reports the apparent consumption of materials in a national economy.  
DMC measures the total amount of material  (biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non -metall ic minerals)  
directly used in an economy and based on accounts of direct material flows, i.e., domestic material 
extraction and physical imports and exports.  Last updated:  2024 -07-29 
 
  
DMC and  Material Footprint ( MF) need to be looked at in combination , as they  cover the two aspects of 
the economy, production and consumption. The DMC reports the actual amount of material in an 
economy, MF the virtual amount required across the whole supply chain to service final demand. A 
country can, for instance , have a very h igh DMC because it has a large primary production sector for 
export or a very low DMC because it has outsourced most of the material intensive industrial process to 
other countries. The material footprint corrects for both phenomena.
