Tourism direct gross value added (TDGVA) is the part of gross value added generated by tourism 
industries and other industries of the economy that directly serve visitors in response to internal tourism 
consumption .  
  
Gross Domestic Product (GDP): It is the main measure of national output, representing the total value of 
all fi nal goods and services within the System of National Accounts (SNA) production boundary produced 
in a particular economy (that is, the dollar value of all goods and services within the SNA production 
boundary produced within a country’s borders  in a given year ). According to the SNA, “GDP is the sum of 
gross value added of all resident producer units plus that part (possibly the total) of taxes on products, less 
subsidies on products, that is not included in the valuation of output . GDP is also equal to the sum of the 
final uses of goods and services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured at purchasers’ prices, 
less the value of imports of goods and services . GDP is also equal to the sum of primary incomes distributed 
by resident producer units.”
