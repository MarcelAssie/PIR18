Definitions:  
The proportion of medium -high and high -tech industry (MHT hereafter) value added in total value added 
of manufacturing (MVA hereafter) is a ratio value between the value added of MHT industry and MVA.

 The value added of an industry (industry value added) is a survey concept that refers to the given industryâ€™s 
net output derived from the difference of gross output and  intermediate consumption. Manufacturing 
sector  is defined according to the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities 
(ISIC) Revision 3 (1990) or Revision 4 (2008). It refers to industries belonging to Section  D in ISIC R evision 3 
or Section  C in ISIC Revision 4.  
 
Technology classification is based on research and development (R&D) expenditure relative to value 
added (R&D intensity  hereafter) .  Data for R&D intensity are presented in a report published by the OECD 
(OECD, 2003 ; Galindo -Rueda  and Verger, 2016 , for ISIC Revision 3 and 4 respectively ), which also 
proposes a taxonomy for industry groups with different ranges of R&D expenditure relative to their gross 
value added. MHT industries have  traditionally been defined exclusively to manufacturing industries. 
However, there have been recent efforts (Galindo -Rueda and Verger, 2016) to extend the definition to 
non-manufacturing industries as well. Nevertheless, medium -high and high technology se ctors are 
primarily represented by manufacturing industries.  
 
The following table includes the classification of MHT industries by ISIC Rev. 3 and ISIC Rev. 4.
