The researchers (in full -time equivalent  - FTE) per million inhabitants is a direct measure of the number of 
research and experimental development (R&D) workers per 1 million people.  
 
  
The Organi sation for Economic Co -operation and Development  (OECD ) Frascati Manual (OECD, 2015) 
provides the relevant definitions for research and experimental  development  (R&D) , gross domestic 
expenditure on research and experimental development (R&D ) and researchers. Although an Last updated:  2024 -07-29 
Organi sation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD ) manual, the application is global. 
During the 6th revision of the Frascati Manual, developing country issues were mainstreamed in the core 
of the Manual. The 7th edition was released in October 2015.  
 
The following definitions, taken from the 2015 edition of the Frascati Manual are relevant for computing 
the indicator.  
 
Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative and systematic work undertaken in 
order to increase the stock of knowled ge – including knowledge of humankind, culture and society – and 
to devise new applications of available knowledge.  
 
Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge. They conduct 
research and improve or develop concepts , theories, models, techniques instrumentation, software or 
operational methods.  
 
The Full -time equivalent (FTE) of research and experimental development (R&D ) personnel is defined as 
the ratio of working hours actually spent on research and experimental d evelopment (R&D ) during a 
specific reference period (usually a calendar year) divided by the total number of hours conventionally 
worked in the same period by an individual or by a group.
