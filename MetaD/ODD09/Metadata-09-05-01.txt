The Organis ation for Economic Co -operation and Development ( OECD ) Frascati Manual (OECD, 2015) 
provides the relevant definitions for research and experimental  development  (R&D) , gross domestic 
expenditure on research and experimental development (R&D ) and researchers. Although an 
Organi sation for Economic Co -operation a nd Development (OECD ) manual, the application is global. 
During the 6th revision of the Frascati Manual, developing country issues were mainstreamed in the core 
of the Manual. The 7th edition was released in October 2015.  
 
The following definitions, taken from the 2015 edition of the Frascati Manual are relevant for computing 
the indicator.  
 
Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative and systematic work undertaken in 
order to increase the stock of knowledge – including knowledge of human kind, culture and society – and 
to devise new applications of available knowledge.  
 
Expenditures on intramural research and experimental development (R&D ) represent the amount of 
money spent on research and experimental development (R&D ) that is performed within a reporting unit.
