The indicator Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas shows trends over time  in the mean 
percentage of each important site for marine biodiversity  (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the 
global persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected areas  and Other Effective 
Area -based Conservation Measures (OECMs) . 
 
  
Protected areas, as defined by the IUCN  (IUCN; Dudley 2008), are clearly defined geographical spaces, 
recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long -term 
conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values.
