Ocean acidification is the decrease of seawater pH  over an extended period, typically of decades or 
longer, which is caused primarily by the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere1.  
This ind icator is based on observations that constrain the ocean carbon system and which are required to 
describe the variability in ocean acidity. The carbon system in this context mainly refers to the four 
measurable parameters: pH (the concentration of hydrogen  ions on a logarithmic scale), DIC (CT; total 
dissolved inorganic carbon), pCO 2 (carbon dioxide partial pressure), and TA (AT, total alkalinity). Average, 
as used here, is the equally weighed annual mean.  
 
An agreed suite of representative sampling statio ns are sites that have a measurement frequency that is 
adequate for describing variability and trends in carbonate chemistry in order to deliver critical 
information on the exposure of and impacts on marine sy stems to ocean acidification, and which provide  
data of sufficient quality and with comprehensive metadata information to enable integration with data 
from other sites in the country.  
 
  
Ocean acidification is caused by an increase in the amount of dissolved atmospheric CO 2 in the seawater. 
The average marine acidity is expressed as pH, the concentration of hydrogen ions on a logarithmic scale. 
In order to be able to constrain the carbonate chemistry of seawater, it is necessary to measure at least 
two of the four parameters , i.e. pH, pCO 2, DIC (CT), and TA (AT). pH (the concentration of hydrogen ions 
on a logarithmic scale, expressed on total scale), DIC (total dissolved inorganic carbon, in μmol kg-1), pCO 2 
(carbon dioxide partial pressure, in ppt or μatm), and TA (AT, tota l alkalinity, in μmol kg-1).
