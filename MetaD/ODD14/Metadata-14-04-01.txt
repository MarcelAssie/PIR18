The indicator, "Proportion of marine fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels", measures the 
sustainability of the world's marine capture fisheries by the abundance of the exploited fish st ocks with 
respect to MSY levels.  
 
For each level of reporting (National, Regional, Global) the indicator is calculated as the ratio between the 
number of exploited fish stocks classified as "within biologically sustainable levels" and the total number Last updated: 2024 -03-28 
of stocks in the reference list  that were classified with a determined status (within/not within 
"biologically sustainable levels").

where Ps is the percentage of stocks classified as "within biologically susta inable levels" for the reference 
list of stocks. Ns is the number of stocks in the reference list  classified as "within biologically sustainable 
levels", Nu is the number of stocks in the reference list  classified as "outside biologically sustainable 
levels" and N = Ns + Nu is the total number of stocks in the reference list  that have been classified as 
within or outside "biologically sustainable levels".  
Classifying individual stocks as within/outside  "biologically sustainable levels":  
In order to keep consistency with the 14.4 target ("at least to levels that can produce maximum 
sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics" and other earlier international 
agreements, including t he United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), a fish stock is 
classified as "within biologically sustainable levels" if its abundance is estimated (considering uncertainty) 
to be equal to or greater than the level that can produce the Maximu m Sustainable Yield (MSY). In 
contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is classified as "outside biologically 
sustainable levels".  
A wide array of methods and approaches (including documented expert opinion) is used to classify stock 
status relative to the abundance producing MSY. This varies among countries, regions and stocks. 
Nevertheless, the reliability of the classification is assessed by FAO as part of the process of producing the 
index.  
 
Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY)  is commonly defined as the greatest average amount of catch that 
can be harvested in the long -term from a stock under constant and current environmental conditions 
(e.g., habitat, water conditions, species composition and interactions, and anything that c ould affect 
birth, growth, or death rates of the stock), without affecting the long -term productivity of the stock. A 
stock can produce MSY if its abundance is above a certain level, usually around 50% of its unexploited 
abundance (but actual value can var y around that level, depending on the biological characteristics of the 
stock).  See more at https://www.fao.org/faoterm/en/?defaultCollId=21  
 
MSY -based r eference points are the most common type of reference points used in fisheries 
management today. This is primarily because, for decades, reference points from surplus production 
models have most often been set based on the concept of MSY and they are the b asic benchmarks for 
the sustainability of fisheries set by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article 61(3)). For 
more on Reference Points in Fish Stock Assessment, see Caddy and Mahon (1995), Cadima (2003) or 
Haddon (2011).  
 
BMSY : Biomass corresponding to Maximum Sustainable Yield from a production model or from an age -
based analysis using a stock recruitment model. Often used as a biological reference point in fisheries 
management, it is the calculated long -term average biomass val ue expected if fishing at FMSY.  
 
A population is:   “A group of individuals of the same species living in the same area at the same time and 
sharing a common gene pool, with little or no immigration or emigration.”

A biological stock is:  “A subpopulation of a species inhabiting a particular geographic area, having  
similar biological characteristics  (e.g. growth, reproduction, mortality) and negligible genetic mixing with 
other adjacent subpopulations  of the same species." (FAO, 2004 -2021).  
 
The reference list  of Stocks:  it is not possible to classify the sustainability of exploitation for all the 
exploited stocks from a country, region or the world. Therefore, the indicator must be calculated based 
on a subset of these stocks. The list of t he stocks that are classified for status and used to calculate the 
indicators is called the " reference list  of Stocks".  
 
The reference list  of Stocks is built differently for the Regional/Global and the National levels.  The 
process of building the reference list  of Stocks for regional and global level are described in FAO (2011). 
At National level, countries are requested to define a list of stocks, based on an agreed set of criteria 
(Appendix 1). National and shar ed stocks can be included, but not straddling stocks (stocks that are 
distributed both in national EEZ and Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction).  
At this moment, there is not a direct correspondence between the national level reference lists  (that are 
defined by each country) and the regional and global Reference lists (that are defined by FAO).  
 
FAO is working on an update of its methodology at global/regional level (FAO, 2024) which also addresses 
needs for convergence with the national level. Full results of the application of this updated methodology 
are planned to be published in 2026.  
 
The detailed description of all necessary concepts can be found in the e -learning course (FAO 2019 -2021).
