The indicator of food price anomalies (IFPA) identifies market prices that are abnormally high. The IFPA 
relies on a weighted compound growth rate that accounts for both within year and across year price 
growth. The indicator directly evaluates growth in p rices over a particular month over many years, taking 
into account seasonality in agricultural markets and inflation, allowing to answer the question of whether 
or not a change in price is abnormal for any particular period.

The indicator of price anomalies  (IFPA) relies on two compound growth rates (CGR’s), a quarterly 
compound growth rate (CQGR) and an annual compound growth rate (CAGR). A CGR is a geometric mean1 
that assumes that a random variable grows at a steady rate, comp ounded over a specific period of time . 
Because it assumes a steady rate of growth  the CGR smoothes the effect of volatility of price changes. The 
CGR is the growth in any random variable from time period  𝑡𝐴 to 𝑡𝐵, raised to the power of one over the 
length of the period of time being considered . 
𝐶𝑋𝐺𝑅 𝑡=(𝑃𝑡𝐵
𝑃𝑡𝐴)1
𝑡𝐵−𝑡𝐴−1           (1) 
where : 
𝐶𝑋𝐺𝑅 𝑡 is the quarterly or annual compound growth rate in month t  
𝑃𝑡𝐴is the p rice at the beginning of the p eriod  
𝑃𝑡𝐵 is the price at the end of the period,  
𝑡𝐵−𝑡𝐴 is the time in months between periods 𝐴 and 𝐵.
