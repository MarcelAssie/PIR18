The indicator measures the percentage of individuals in the population who have experienced food 
insecurity at moderate or severe levels during the reference period. The severity of food insecurity, 
defined as a latent trait, is measured on the Food Insecu rity Experience Scale global reference scale, a Last updated:  2024 -07-09 
measurement standard established by FAO through the application of the Food Insecurity Experience 
Scale in more than 140 countries worldwide, starting in 2014.  
 
  
Extensive research over more than 25 years has demonstrated that the inability to access food results in 
a series of experiences and conditions that are fairly common across cultures and socio -economic 
contexts and that range from being concerned about the ability to obtain enough food, to  the need to 
compromise on the quality or the diversity of food consumed, to being forced to reduce the intake of 
food by cutting portion sizes or skipping meals, up to the extreme condition of feeling hungry and not 
having means to access any food for a w hole day. Typical conditions like these form the basis of an 
experience -based food insecurity measurement scale. When analysed through sound statistical methods 
rooted in Item Response Theory, data collected through such scales provide the basis to compute  
theoretically consistent, cross country comparable measures of the prevalence of food insecurity. The 
severity of the food insecurity condition as measured by this indicator thus directly reflects the extent of 
households’ or individuals’ inability to reg ularly access the food they need.
