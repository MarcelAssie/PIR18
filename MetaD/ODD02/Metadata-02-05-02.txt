A similar indicator was o riginally proposed for the Target 15.5, and it serves also as an indicator for the 
Aichi Target 13 “Genetic Diversity of Terrestrial Domesticated Animals” under the Convention on 
Biological Diversity (CBD). It is described on the webpage of the Biodiversit y Indicators Partnership (BIP), 
a network of organizations, which have come together to provide the most up -to date biodiversity 
information possible for tracking progress towards the Aichi Targets 
(http://www.bipindicators.net/domesticatedanimals). Furthe r, it is presented in the Global Biodiversity 
Outlook 4, page 91 (see https://www.cbd.int/gbo/gbo4/publication/gbo4 -en.pdf  ) which is an output of 
the pr ocesses under the CBD.
