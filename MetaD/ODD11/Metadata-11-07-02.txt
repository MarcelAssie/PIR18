Number of persons who have been victims of non-sexual  harassment or sexual harassment, as a 
percentage of the total population of the relevant area.  
 
  
The operational definition s of non-sexual  and sexual harassment are based on  the International 
Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) . While sexual harassment refers to a non -physical 
behaviour with a sexual connotation that is suitable to intimidate the victim, non-sexual  harassment 
refers to all other non-sexual harassing behaviours that can cause fear for physical integrity and/or 
emotional distress. This type of non-sexual harassment formulated by the indicator overlap s to some  
extent with psychological violence.   
 
The internationally standardized and tested SDG 16 Survey questionnaire  and the accompanying 
Implementation Manual , which can be used by countries  for collecting data SDG indicator  11.7.2 on non-
sexual  and sexual harassment , provide a core set of questions about specific behaviours  that allow for the 
measurement of the prevalence of sexual and non-sexual  harassment in the population (see Figures 1 
and 2 below).  In addition, t he regionally standardized and tested  methodology, the Latin America and the 
Caribbean Crime Victimization Survey Initiative (LACSI) , offers a standardised  methodology the 
measurement of indicator 11.7.2 and uses the same  types of behaviours , both for non -sexual harassment 
and sexual harassme nt, but considering one additional behaviour indicative of  sexual harassment: 
Somebody followed you and made you feel uncomfortable with sexual intentions . 
 
While the precise formulation and wording of the pertinent survey questions may need national 
custo mization, a core set of behaviours have been identified as forms of sexual and non-sexual  
harassment exercised towards a person :

The SDG 16 survey  instrument , developed by the  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
(UNODC) , the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) , is designed as a flexible tool that can be adapted to 
national need s. It can either be applied as a standalone population survey or, if necessary, countries 
can implement sele cted modules as part of other ongoing survey operations.  
 
The LACSI survey instrument , developed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)  
with the support of the  Inter -American Development Bank ( IADB ), Organization of American States 
(OAS ) and the United Nations Development Program ( UNDP ), is designed as an independent crime 
victimization survey that can be adapted to the national needs  and covers a wide range of criminal
