  Last updated:  2024 -07-29 
The indicator Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity  shows temporal 
trends in the mean percentage of each important site for mountain  biodiversity (i.e., those that 
contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected 
areas  and Other Effective Area -based  Conservation Measures (OECMs) . 
 
  
Protected areas, as defined by the IUCN (IUCN; Dudley 2008), are clearly defined geographical spaces, 
recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long -term 
conservatio n of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values.
