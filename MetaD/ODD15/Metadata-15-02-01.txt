“Sustainable forest management” (SFM) is a central concept for Goal 15 and target 15.1 as well as for 
target 15.2. It has been formal ly defined, by the UN General Assembly, as follows:

[a] dynamic and evolving concept [that] aims to maintain and enhance the economic, social  and 
environmental values of all types of forests, for the benefit of present and future generations ” (Resolution 
A/RES/62/98)  
 
The indicator is composed of five sub -indicators that measure progress towards all dimensions of 
sustainable forest management. The environmental values of forests are covered by three sub -indicators 
focused on the extension of forest area, biomass within the forest area and protection and maintenance 
of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources. Social and economic values of 
forests are reconciled with environmental values through sustainable management plans. The sub -
indicator  provides further qualification to the management of forest areas, by assessing areas which are 
independently verified for compliance with a set of national or international standards.  
 
The sub -indicators are:  
1. Annual f orest area change rate  
2. Above -ground  biomass in forest  
3. Proportion of forest area within legally established protect ed areas  
4. Proportion of forest area under a long -term management plan  
5. Forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme  
 
A dashboard is used to assess progress related to the five sub -indicators. The adoption of the dashboard 
approach aims at ensuring consideration of all dimensions of sustainable forest management and 
provides for clear view of areas where progress has been achieved.
