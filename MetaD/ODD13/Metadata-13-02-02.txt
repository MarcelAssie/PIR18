Definition, rationale and concepts:  
The ultimate objective of the Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) is to achieve the stabilization of 
greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous 
anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Estimating the levels of gree nhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions and removals is an important element of the efforts to achieve this objective.  
In accordance with Articles 4 and 12 of the Climate Change Convention and the relevant decisions of the 
Conference of the Parties, countries that are Parties to the Convention submit national GHG inventories 
to the Climate Change secretariat. These submissions are made in accordance with the reporting 
requirements adopted under the Convention, such as the revised “Guidelines for the preparation of 
natio nal communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention, Part I: UNFCCC reporting 
guidelines on annual greenhouse gas inventories” (decision 24/CP.19) for Annex I Parties and “Guidelines 
for the preparation of national communications for non -Annex I Parties” (decision 17/CP.8). The 
inventory data are provided in the annual GHG inventory submissions by Annex I Parties and in the 
national communications and biennial update reports by non -Annex I Parties.  Last updated:  2021 -03-01 
The Paris Agreement adopted in 2015 marks t he latest step in the evolution of the UN climate change 
regime and builds on the work undertaken under the Convention. Its central aim is to strengthen the 
global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century w ell 
below 2 degrees Celsius above pre -industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature 
increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement also aims to strengthen the ability of 
countries to deal with the impacts of climate change.
