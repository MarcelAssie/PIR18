The indicator is defined as the installed capacity of power plants that generate electricity from renewable 
energy sources divided by the total population of a country. Capacity is defined as the net maximum 
electrical capacity installed at the year -end and renewable energy sources are as defined in the IRENA 
Statute (see concepts below).  
 
  
Electricity capacity is def ined in the International Recommendations for Energy Statistics or IRES ( UN, 
2018 ) as the maximum active power that can be supplied continuously (i.e., throughout a prolonged 
period in a day with the whole plant running) at the point of outlet (i.e., after  taking the power supplies 
for the station auxiliaries and allowing for the losses in those transformers considered integral to the Last updated:  2024-03-28 
station). This assumes no restriction of interconnection to the network. It does not include overload 
capacity that can only  be sustained for a short period of time (e.g., internal combustion engines 
momentarily running above their rated capacity).  
 
The IRENA Statute defines renewable energy to include energy from the following sources: hydropower; 
marine energy (ocean, tidal a nd wave energy); wind energy; solar energy (photovoltaic and thermal 
energy); bioenergy; and geothermal energy.
