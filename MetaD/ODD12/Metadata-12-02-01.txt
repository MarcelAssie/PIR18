Material Footprint (MF) is the attribution of global material extraction to domestic final demand of a 
country. The total material footprint is the sum of the material footprint for biomass, fossil fuels, metal 
ores and non -metal lic minerals .  
 
  
Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) and MF need to be looked at in combination , as they cover the 
two aspects of the  economy, production and consumption. The DMC reports the actual amount of 
material in an economy, MF the virtual amount required across the whole supply chain to service final 
demand. A country can, for instance , have a very high DMC because it has a large primary production Last updated: 2024 -07-29 
sector for export or a very low DMC because it has outs ourced most of the material intensive industrial 
process to other countries. The material footprint corrects for both phenomena.
