 Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause 
death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes, ICC S 2015); 
population refers to total resident population in a given country in a given year.  
 
  
The International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) is the source of the definition  of 
intentional homicide . 
Intentional homicide (ICCS 0101): Unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause  death 
or serious injury.  
The statistical definition contains three elements that characterize the killing of a person as  “intentional 
homicide”:  
1. The killing of a perso n by another person (objective element);  
2. The intent of the perpetrator to kill or seriously injure the victim (subjective element);  
3. The unlawfulness of the killing, which means that the law considers the perpetrator liable for the 
unlawful death (leg al element).  
 
This definition states that, for statistical purposes, all killings corresponding to the three criteria above 
should be considered as intentional homicides, irrespective of definitions provided by national 
legislations or practices.  
 
In the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) , deaths coded with ICD -10 codes X85 -Y09 (injuries 
inflicted by another person with intent to injure or kill) and ICD -10 code Y87.1 (sequelae of assault), or 
ICD-11 codes PD50 -PF2Z  and PJ20 -PJ2Z , generally correspond to the definition of intentional homicide 
discussed above.
