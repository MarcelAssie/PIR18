“Neighbourhood” – the indicator aims to capture  fear of crime in the context of peopl e’s everyday lives. 
It does so by limiting the area in question to the “neighbourhood” or “area  they live in ”. Various other 
formulations of local neighbourhood may be appropriate depending on cultural, physical and language 
context . Providing a universally applicable definition of neighborhood is challenging, as one’s 
neighbourhood is a subjective concept that will mean different things to different people.1  
 
“After dark ”- the indicator should specifically capture  respondent’s feelings and perceptions when  
walking alone after dark . The specific reference to darkness  is important  because according to research ,2 
darkness is one of the factors individuals perceive  as important when assessing whether  a situation is 
dangerous.  While the specific reference to “after dark” is the preferrable wording  and widely used in 
crime victimisation survey s,3 a suitable alternative wording is “at night”.4 Specifying an exact time of the 
day (e.g. 6pm), however, is not advisable as darkness (not time of day per se) is the factor that affects 
individuals perception of safety , and cross -national as well as seasonal variation in the onset of darkness 
makes i t problematic to establish a universally suitable threshold  to define nighttime.
