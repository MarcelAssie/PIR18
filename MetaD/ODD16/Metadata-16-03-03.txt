Number of persons who experienced a dispute during the past two years who accessed a formal or  
informal dispute resolution mechanism, as a percentage of all those who experienced a dispute in 
the past  two years, by type of mechanism.   
  
A dispute  can be understood as a justiciable problem  between individuals or between individual(s) 
and an entity. Justiciable problems can be seen as the ones giving rise to legal issues , whether or not   
the problems are perceived as being “legal” by those who face them, and whether or not any legal 
action was taken as a result of the problem .1 
Categories of disputes can vary between countries depending on social, economic, political, legal, in-
stitutional and cultural factors. There are, however, a number of categories that have broad  applica-
bility across countries, such as problems or disputes r elated to:2 
- Land or buying and selling property  
- Family and relationship break -ups 
- Injuries or illnesses caused by an intentional or unintentional act or omission of another per-
son or entity  
- Occupation/employment  
- Commercial transactions (including defective or undelivered goods or services)  
- Government and public services (including abuse by public officials)  
- Government payments   
- Housing (Tenancy and landlord)   
- Debt, damage compensation, and other financial matters  
- Environmental damage (la nd or water pollution, waste dumping, etc.)  
Dispute resolution mechanisms  vary across countries around the world. While in many countries 
courts represent the main institution dealing with disputes of civil nature, the same may not be true 
in countries or societies where the first point of reference in such cases are informal systems, tradi-
tional or religious leaders. The formulation of the indicator, and the formulation of the questions  in 
the survey, have to account for these differences and make sure to include all relevant institutions      or 
mechanisms that are generally recognized and used.  
A list of dispute resolution mechanisms could include:   
- Lawyer or third -party mediation  
- Community or religious leaders or other customary law mechanisms   
- A court or  tribunal  
- The police  
- A government office or other formal designated authority or agency

- Other formal complaints or appeal procedure   
To improve the accuracy of the indicator it is important to define precisely the denominator (the  
population at ‘risk’ of experiencing the event of interest, i.e. accessing a dispute -resolution  mecha-
nism) by identifying the ‘demand’ of dispute resolution mechanisms. This demand is  composed of 
those who use dispute resolution mechanisms (users) and thos e who - despite needing them - do 
not have “access” to such mechanisms for various reasons such as lack of knowledge on how to ac-
cess them, lack of trust in institutions, lack of legal advice/assistance, lack of awareness about justice 
mechanisms, geograph ical distance or financial costs, to mention a few. It is important to exclude 
from the demand those who experience disputes and do not turn to dispute resolution mechanisms 
because they do not need them (voluntarily self -excluded). This refers to cases wh ere the dispute is 
simple or when respondents solve  the issue with the other party through direct negotiation.
