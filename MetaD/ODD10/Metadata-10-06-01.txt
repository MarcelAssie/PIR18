The indicator Proportion  of members and voting rights of developing countries in international  
organizations has two separate componen ts: the developing country proportion of voting rights and 
the developing country proportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions , 
these two  components  are identical.  
 
The indicator is calculated independently for eleven different international institutions: The United  
Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Last updated:  2022 -07-07  
Social  Council, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development,  the International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian 
Development Bank, the  Inter -American  Development  Bank, the  World  Trade  Organisation,  and the  
Financial  Stability Board.  
 
  
There is no established conventio n for the designation of "developed" and "developing" countries or  
areas in the United Nations system. The  aggregation  across  all institutions  is currently  done  according  
to the “historical” classification of “Developed regions” and “Developing regions” as  of December 2021  
in the United  Nations M49  statistical standard . The removal of this classification from the M49 
standard at the end of 2021 makes it more urgent  to reach agreement on how to define these terms 
for the purposes of SDG  monitoring. The designations "developed" and developing" are intended for 
statistical convenience and  do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a 
particular co untry or area in the  development  process.
