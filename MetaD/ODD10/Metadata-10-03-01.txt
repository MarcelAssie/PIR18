This indicator is defined as the proportion of the population (adults) who self -report that they personally 
experienced discrimination or harassment during the last 12 months based on ground(s) prohibited by 
international human rights law  (IHRL) . IHRL  refers to the body of international legal instruments aiming to Last updated: 2024 -09-27 
   
 promote and protect human rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR ) and sub-
sequent international human rights treaties adopted by the United Nations  (UN) . 
 
  
Discrimination is any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference or other differential treatment that 
is directly or indirectly based on prohibited grounds of discrimination, and which has the intention or ef-
fect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public 
life.1 Harassment is a form of discrimination when it is also based on prohibited grounds of discrimina-
tion. Harassment may take the form of words, gestures or actions, which tend to annoy, alarm, abuse, 
demean, intimidate, belittle, humiliate or embarrass another or which create an intimidating,  hostile or 
offensive envir onment. While generally involving a pattern of behaviours, harassment can take the form 
of a single incident.2 
IHRL  provides lists of the prohibited grounds of discrimination. The inclusion of “other status” in these 
lists indicate that they are not exhaustive and that other grounds may be recognized by international hu-
man rights mechanisms. A review of the international human rights normative framework helps identify a 
list of grounds that includes race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national origin, 
social origin, property, birth status, disability, age, nationality, marital and family status, sexual orienta-
tion, gender identity, health status, place of residence, economic and social sit uation, pregnancy, indige-
nous status, afro -descent and other status.3 In practice, it will be difficult to include all potentially rele-
vant grounds of discrimination in household survey questions. For this reason, it is recommended that 
data collectors id entify contextually relevant and feasible lists of grounds, drawing on the illustrative list 
and formulation of prohibited grounds of discrimination outlined in the methodology section below, and 
add an “other” category to reflect other grounds that may no t have been listed explicitly.
