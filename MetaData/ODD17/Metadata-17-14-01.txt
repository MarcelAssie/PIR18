For the purpose of this methodology ‘policy coherence of sustainable development’ has been interpreted as the coherence between policies in general that cover the dimensions of sustainable development. This indicator is a composite indicator which covers mechanisms related to: 
Institutionalization of Political Commitment 	
Long-term considerations in decision-making
Inter-ministerial and cross-sectoral coordination	
Participatory processes
Policy linkages
Alignment across government levels
Monitoring and reporting for policy coherence
Financing for policy coherence


Scope of “Sustainable Development”: For the purpose of this methodology ‘policy coherence of sustainable development’ has been interpreted as the coherence between policies in general that cover the dimensions of sustainable development, rather than adopting a narrower definition of mechanisms put in place to support the coherent implementation of Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), so as to promote coherent policy for sustainable development well beyond the current agenda’s timeframe. The policy coherence mechanisms set out in this methodology may therefore include mechanisms already in place before the adoption of the 2030 Agenda in 2015, and any mechanisms established during the next decade leading up to 2030 should aim to continue well beyond that timeframe. However, given the role of Agenda 2030 and the individual goals in defining the specific parameters of sustainable development, it is likely that governments will focus, in implementing this methodology, on bringing coherence in their policy approaches to implement the goals. 

The concept of Policy Coherence: The textual formulation of the indicator covers “policy coherence”. In order to make the indicator universally applicable and adaptable to various national contexts, the mechanisms measured by the methodology cover a wide range of mechanisms that, although aiming to achieve the same objective, use slightly different language. In order to properly assess and report on this indicator, similar concepts such as “whole of government approach or “integrated approach” will be interpreted in the same spirit as the concept of “policy coherence”. However, it is important that the used concept considers policies that cover the various dimensions of sustainable development. Hence, a mechanism focusing solely on the concept of policy coherence for development (which is often limited to coherence between Official Development Assistance (ODA) and other policies, in the spirit of the Millennium Development Goals) will not be considered by this framework.
