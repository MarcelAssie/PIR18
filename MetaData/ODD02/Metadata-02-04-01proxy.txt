Over the past 30 years, the definition and measurement of sustainable agriculture has been much debated. According to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the performance of all sectors, including agriculture, must be assessed against the three dimensions of sustainability: economic, social and environmental. Until recently, there has been no internationally agreed method to measure sustainable agriculture. The SDG process created the opportunity to develop a commonly accepted measurement method. SDG target 2.4 requires that by 2030, countries “ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality”. During a meeting in December 2022, the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs), which governs the overall SDG monitoring process, endorsed the new methodology relating to SDG indicator 2.4.1, which operationalizes an internationally agreed definition of sustainable agriculture.
