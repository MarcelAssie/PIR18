The renewable energy share in total final consumption is the percentage of final consumption of energy that is derived from renewable resources.


Renewable energy consumption includes consumption of energy derived from: hydro, wind, solar, solid biofuels, liquid biofuels, biogas, geothermal, marine and renewable waste. Total final energy consumption is calculated from balances as total final consumption minus non-energy use. 

Comments regarding specific renewable energy sources: 
Solar energy includes solar PV and solar thermal. 
Liquid biofuels include biogasoline, biodiesels and other liquid biofuels. 
Solid biofuels include fuelwood, animal waste, vegetable waste, black liquor, bagasse and charcoal.
