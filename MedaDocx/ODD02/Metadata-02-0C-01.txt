The indicator of food price anomalies (IFPA) identifies market prices that are abnormally high. The IFPA relies on a weighted compound growth rate that accounts for both within year and across year price growth. The indicator directly evaluates growth in prices over a particular month over many years, taking into account seasonality in agricultural markets and inflation, allowing to answer the question of whether or not a change in price is abnormal for any particular period.


The indicator of price anomalies (IFPA) relies on two compound growth rates (CGRâ€™s), a quarterly compound growth rate (CQGR) and an annual compound growth rate (CAGR). A CGR is a geometric mean that assumes that a random variable grows at a steady rate, compounded over a specific period of time. Because it assumes a steady rate of growth the CGR smoothes the effect of volatility of price changes. The CGR is the growth in any random variable from time period  to , raised to the power of one over the length of the period of time being considered.
