The indicator monitors the “transboundary basin” area within a country covered by an “operational” “arrangement for water cooperation”. 

A “transboundary basin” refers to a river or lake basin, or an aquifer system that marks, crosses or is located on boundaries between two or more states. A basin comprises the entire catchment area of a surface water body (river or lake), or for groundwater, the area of the aquifer, i.e. the entire permeable water-bearing geological formation. For the purpose of calculating the value of SDG indicator 6.5.2 the transboundary basin area is the extent of the catchment area (river or lake basin); or the extent of the aquifer. 

“Arrangement for water cooperation” refers to a bilateral or multilateral treaty, convention, agreement or other formal arrangement, such as memorandum of understanding between countries sharing transboundary basins that provides a framework for cooperation on transboundary water management. Agreements or other kinds of formal arrangements may be interstate, intergovernmental, interministerial, interagency or between regional authorities. 

“Operational” means that an agreement for cooperation between the countries sharing transboundary basins meets all the following four criteria: 

- There is a joint body or mechanism (e.g. a river basin organization) for transboundary cooperation;
- There are regular, i.e., at least annual, formal communications between riparian countries in form of meetings (either at the political and/or technical level);
- There is a joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or joint objectives have been set;
- There is a regular, i.e., at least annual, exchange of data and information.


The monitoring has as its basis the spatial coverage of transboundary basins shared by each country, and focuses on monitoring whether these are covered by cooperation arrangements that are “operational”. The criteria to be met for the cooperation on a specific basin to be considered “operational” seek to capture whether the arrangement(s) provides the basic elements needed to allow that arrangement to implement cooperation in water management.
