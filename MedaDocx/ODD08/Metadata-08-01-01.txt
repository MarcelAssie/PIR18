Annual growth rate of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is calculated as the percentage
change in the real GDP per capita between two consecutive years. Real GDP per capita is calculated by
dividing GDP at constant prices by the population of a country or area. The data for real GDP are
measured in constant US dollars to facilitate the calculation of country growth rates and aggregation of
the country data.
