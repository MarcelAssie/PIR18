Definitions:
Manufacturing value added (MVA) as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) is a ratio between MVA and GDP, both reported in constant 2015 USD.

MVA per capita is calculated by dividing MVA in constant 2015 USD by population of a country or area.


The gross value added measures the contribution to the economy of each individual producer, industry or sector in a country. The gross value added generated by any unit engaged in production activity can be calculated as the residual of the unitsâ€™ total output less intermediate consumption, goods and services used up in the process of producing the output, or as the sum of the factor incomes generated by the production process (System of National Accounts 2008). Manufacturing refers to industries belonging to the section C defined by International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4, or D defined by ISIC Revision 3.

GDP represents the sum of gross value added from all institutional units resident in the economy. For the purpose on comparability over time and across countries MVA and GDP are estimated in terms of constant prices in USD. The current series are given at constant prices of 2015.
