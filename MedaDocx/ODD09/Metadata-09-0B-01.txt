Definitions:
The proportion of medium-high and high-tech industry (MHT hereafter) value added in total value added of manufacturing (MVA hereafter) is a ratio value between the value added of MHT industry and MVA.


The value added of an industry (industry value added) is a survey concept that refers to the given industryâ€™s net output derived from the difference of gross output and intermediate consumption. Manufacturing sector is defined according to the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 3 (1990) or Revision 4 (2008). It refers to industries belonging to Section D in ISIC Revision 3 or Section C in ISIC Revision 4.

Technology classification is based on research and development (R&D) expenditure relative to value added (R&D intensity hereafter).  Data for R&D intensity are presented in a report published by the OECD (OECD, 2003; Galindo-Rueda and Verger, 2016, for ISIC Revision 3 and 4 respectively), which also proposes a taxonomy for industry groups with different ranges of R&D expenditure relative to their gross value added. MHT industries have traditionally been defined exclusively to manufacturing industries. However, there have been recent efforts (Galindo-Rueda and Verger, 2016) to extend the definition to non-manufacturing industries as well. Nevertheless, medium-high and high technology sectors are primarily represented by manufacturing industries.

The following table includes the classification of MHT industries by ISIC Rev. 3 and ISIC Rev. 4.

* Excluding 301 (Building of ships and boats)
** Excluding 351 (Building and repairing of ships and boats)

MVA is the value added of manufacturing industry, which is Section C of ISIC Rev.4 or Section D of ISIC Rev.3.
