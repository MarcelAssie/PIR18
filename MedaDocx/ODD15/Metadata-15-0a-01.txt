This is a twin indicator consisting of:

a) Official development assistance on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, defined as gross disbursements of total Official Development Assistance (ODA) from all donors for biodiversity. 
b) revenue generated and finance mobilised from biodiversity-relevant economic instruments, defined as revenue generated and finance mobilised from biodiversity-relevant economic instruments, covering biodiversity-relevant taxes, fees and charges, and positive subsidies. (New on-going work is underway to collect data on payments for ecosystem services and biodiversity offsets -- including the finance they mobilise for biodiversity).


a) The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) defines ODA as those flows to countries and territories on the DAC list of ODA recipients and multilateral institutions which are:
Provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and
Each transaction of which:
 is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and
is concessional in character.
 (See http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm).

b)  The Environmental Policy Committee (EPOC) collects data on Policy Instruments for the Environment (to the OECD PINE database), including biodiversity-relevant economic instruments. Currently more than 110 countries are contributing data. For 2020 data, see  Tracking Economic Instruments and Finance for Biodiversity -2020.
