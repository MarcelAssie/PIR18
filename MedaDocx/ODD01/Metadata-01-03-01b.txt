Coverage of social protection and labor (SPL) is the percentage of population participating in social insurance, social assistance, and labor market programs. Estimates include both direct and indirect beneficiaries (number of individuals who live in a household where at least one member participates in a social protection program).


CoverageCoverage is estimated by three social protection areasareas: social insurance, social assistance and labor market programs.  The indicator is calculated for the entire population and for the poorest quintile, which is generated usingusingper capita incomeincome or consumption including transfers.   

The source of the indicator is the Atlas of Social Protection: Indicators of Resilience and Equity (ASPIRE).  ASPIRE is the World Bank's premier compilation of indicators to analyze the scope and performance of social protection programs.  Developed by the Social Protection and Jobs (SPJ) Global Practice, ASPIRE provides indicators for 130+ countries on social assistance, social insurance and labor market programs based on both program-level administrative data and national household survey data.  ASPIRE is an ongoing project that aims to improve SPL data quality, comparability, and availability to better inform SPL policies and programs.
